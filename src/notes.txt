* express.Request becomes IWebRequest
* express.NextFunction becomes INextFunction

* cannot use advanced types on bindable arguments - only primitives and classes: e.g. 'string | null' will not work!

* primitive action arguments can be marked for validation, and class arguments can be validated also

* we don't work with Request, Next and Response in controllers anymore
