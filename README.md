#### Just Another Framework for Express.
Well, it is a mess for now, although I hope at 1.0.0 it won't be anymore.  
It was written with sole purpose to support one of express' projects
but then I decided to make it opensource.  
*Some parts may not work at all, or not as intended.* Feel free to create
issues here on Github

##### Includes
* custom authorization
* request data binding
* validation.
 
Tries to make code look 'less express', yet keeping it simple
